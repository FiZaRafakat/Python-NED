# Python Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** repository! This repo showcases my learnings, projects, and practices during the Python course at **NED Academy**. Along the way, I also utilized **Git** and **GitHub** to manage and push code regularly, documenting my progress effectively. 🐍

## About the Course 📚

- **Duration:** 1-2 months  
- **Institution:** NED Academy  
- **Focus Areas:** Python programming fundamentals, practical exercises, and Git/GitHub workflows.  

This course emphasized Python's core concepts while also introducing tools for version control. My prior knowledge of version control helped me automate and manage code pushes at the end of each class. 💡
