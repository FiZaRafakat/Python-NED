# What is python??
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

### Why we use it ??
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

### Benefits Of Python
- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

### Comments in Python::
- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
- In python comments is executed with # => shortcut ctrl + /

# Variables :: 

Variables are containers for storing data values.

##### Key Point
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set, but it can be casting.....!!!

### Rule For Naming Variable
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
- For Multi Words Variable Names {
         - Camel Case
         - Pascal Case
         - Snake Case }


##  Indentation 

 - Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
 - Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
 - Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. 
 - in other language we create block of loops , if , else etc in curly braces { }
 - The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
 - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error
