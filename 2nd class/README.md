# What is Module ?

Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

#### Types Of Modules
### Built-in Module 

just use import and used it 

like random module gives you a random number.

##### What  is Pip ?
###### PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.
###### What is Package ?
###### A package contains all the files you need for a module.  Modules are Python code libraries you can include in your project like npm .

Here We use this in random_jokes. 

Simple use this by writing command "pip intsall (pkg name)" in you terminal.


# Basic Data Types

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

String

Integer

Float

Boolean

Complex number

You can also specify a varaible types using type Casting....

## Type Casting
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

- int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
- float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
- str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

# Operaotors 

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator Example 
-      Addition	x + y	
-	   Subtraction	x - y	
-  	   Multiplication	x * y	
-	   Division	x / y	
-      Modulus	x % y	
-      Exponentiation	x ** y	
-	   Floor division	x // y



# String

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function
