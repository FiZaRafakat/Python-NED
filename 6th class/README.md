# list
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
### List Item
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.


- When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
  
  If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created. 

- Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value

- To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function 

- A list can contain different data types

- From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list'
