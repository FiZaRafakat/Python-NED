'''Python is a case sensitive language.
Following are the "donts" while declaring a variable
1) Variable name ,ust not be a python's keyword. 
For example: as , break , continue , for , in , and , or , try , finally , except, etc....
2) Variable name must not be started with any number. For exapmle : '2_my_variable' is incorrect
3) There must not be any space  in between variables
